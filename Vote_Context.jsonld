    "comment": "✅I believe our treasury is sufficiently funded to drive objectives, and even at a 10% tax rate will grow (especially in USD terms) sufficiently to drive downstream deliverables.\n✅I believe that allocating additional capital to stakers helps drive increased on-chain activity and liquidity in our existing CNTs, DApps, and Defi platforms.\n✅I believe this action is an excellent opportunity that demonstrates the empowerment of our #Cardano community through governance. A reasonable, democratic, establishment of the tax rate that was otherwise established in a centralized manner under very different concerns and circumstances.\n✅Nothing about this action precludes the community from agreeing to an alternative tax rate in the future if there is concern our treasury is not sufficiently funded.\n✅I'd rather see a more conservative funding of the treasury until we have demonstrated a degree of discretion and collective wisdom allocating funds in this new governance era.
